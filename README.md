# Welcome
You've found my portfolio! Nothing fancy â€“ feel free to have a look around. I apologize in advance about the mostly uncommented spaghetti code.

## Setup
Pretty simple... `git clone git@github.com:lehelbabos/about.git && cd about/ && npm install`... You'll also need to install `gulp-cli` and a few other things... If it's throwing you errors and you can't get it sorted gimmie a shout. 

## Run local
Once you're done setting up just hit `npm start` which will load up `grunt` start `watching` all the source files and spin up a `server` and opens the page in the browser. *Might* need to refresh first time you load.

Bon voyage!
