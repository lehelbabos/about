Our value\nproposition was simple.\n\n * Your own your data: We’re not in the business of trying to monetize your\n   restaurant or your client data. TableCheck puts your business’ privacy first.\n * Flat monthly fee. No charges for reservations: We won’t nickel and dime you\n   or charge you a percentage on your reservations. Pay a flat monthly fee for\n   the services you want and we’ll get out of your way.\n * Tailored for your niche: We’ve built features and workflows that are uniquely\n   tailored to high end restaurants in the APAC and some European markets.\n\nFor restaurants looking specifically at leveraging our reservation form, here’s\nwhat this meant:\n\n * A white label solution. Your brand, our tech. Where you can customize as much\n   or as little as you want.\n * Ability to sell and promote multi-course meals with the option to require a\n   full or partial payment ahead of time.\n * The ability to have separate, easily customizable booking forms you can\n   promote independently for special promotions.\n * Free as in beer… If you’re a TableCheck customer, you automatically have\n   access to this feature and reservations booked through this form don’t incur\n   any additional fee.\n\nSounds great right? The experience and the value for restaurants is super\ncompelling. There was just one problem; the experience of booking a reservation\nusing the form, aka the diner experience – sucked.\n\nUnderstanding the problem\nWhy does this matter? Well… the form is only as good as its conversion rate. If\ndiners come to the form, but can’t figure it out, or are put off by it and\nabandon their booking, we’ve failed. And unfortunately, that’s what we were\nfinding. Though the system was very flexible and  allowed restaurants a great\ndeal of flexibility, the execution and implementation of these features on the\ndiner side needed to be improved. \n\nSo here is how we went about solving the problem.\n\nOur process\nPersonas and Needs Statements\nWe built two sets of personas to help us better target our solutions (not just\non this project but all our design work as a whole). The first set of personas\nhelped us better understand the various different professionals working in these\nrestaurants and using our products. These personas were built on research and\ndiscussions with our sales and support teams, our own interactions with clients,\nas well as analytics from our various sites and tools showing things like what\npercentage of our clients were small business owners vs parts of a broader chain\nof restaurants (usually associated with hotels).\n\nThe second set of personas were about the diners who ate at these restaurants\nand would be the primary users of the form we were redesigning. For the diner\npersonas, we had the benefit of having direct access to our clients’ customer\nmeta-data so we were able to build a fairly accurate picture of some common\ngroups of people that our clients served and we based out work off that. Above\nare some examples of the personas and use cases we built to help guide us on our\njourney and level set across our team.\n\nHighlighting the pain points\nTo help better define the specific pain points diners were experiencing, we took\nthe most common journey and walked through an “As-Is Scenario Map” to both get a\nbetter understanding of the structure of the current flow as well as where the\nmain problem areas are.\n\nWe did the first, most common journey’s map as a team, as a way to again level\nset around some of the common pain points and elements. After this, I went\nthrough the additional journeys, focusing on different type of booking scenarios\nfrom different entry points such as a social media post, the restaurants own\nsite, or Google Reservations, and seeing where the unique pain points and\nrequirements are.\n\nTo view additional journeys etc… please open in Figma\n[https://www.figma.com/file/BtbL4LDf7uyLbDi0NuJPw4/0814-As-Is-Scenario-Maps?node-id=0%3A1]\nMapping out a solution\nOnce we’ve taken stock of how things were, it was time to start planning out how\nwe wanted them to be. We took some of these same scenarios and without focusing\non the UI itself just yet, started mapping out the higher level form structure\nand information architecture of each step. The focus here was to maintain\nfeature parity with the existing experience, but organize the content in a way\nthat is\n\n * Modular – some of these screens can be shown in different order, depending on\n   the entry point or if the user has certain fields pre-populated for them\n * Familiar – Makes sense and presents the right information at the right time.\n\nPlease open in Figma\n[https://www.figma.com/file/UxDCs0lgf1uDIX169FaHjv/0822-To-Be-Scenario-Map-Highlights] \nto see some additional journeys and how they compareEach card in the middle and\nright columns corresponds to a different view or screen. Items in the Expected\ncolumn are things that the user would expect to see on that page ; they’re table\nstakes. Familiar are the elements that wouldn’t subvert user expectations and\nare familiar but may not be part of their core set up or relevant to everyone.\nItems that are grayed out are functions we had to keep in the flow but would be\nde-prioritized in the UI.\n\nPlease open in Miro [https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lJMTvj4=/]to view the full\ntask flows and different scenariosAs we were doing this, we also mapped out the\nmore detailed task flows, to make sure we captured not just the “happy paths”\nbut provided guardrails and ramps for users to get back on track if they run\ninto any issues (such as not finding an available date at first).\n\nPrototype\nOne benefit of this being a fairly late stage project is that our design system\nand component library was relatively well fleshed out. While we initially\nstarted with wireframing we realized we can just jump to high fidelity and use\nthe IA diagrams above as a guide for overall UI structure – so that’s exactly\nwhat we did. We put together a rapid prototype to give our stakeholders a better\nsense of the general direction we were going.\n\n\nThis allowed us to test internally and more importantly, put this in front of\nsome clients we had a closer relationship with and gather their feedback. The\nidea was that we knew we weren’t getting everything perfect and some of this\nstill needed work, but it’s better to make a decision and validate, than to be\nstuck in a cycle of endless tweaks with no outside set of eyes to provide\nfeedback.\n\nPlease Open in Figma\n[https://www.figma.com/file/a08ZYSLeANrrXklUsgNSPn/0903-TC-Redesign?node-id=0%3A1] \nto view prototypeIterate\nLuckily the feedback from our clients was generally positive! But we did get\nsome feedback on some things we needed to adjust. This included:\n\n * Switching to a non-stepped progress indicator\n * The option for providing a cleaner separation of Course Selected vs Time\n   selected journeys first for users who come in through the general form\n * The ability to add images to show examples of what different seating\n   arrangements look like. (Semi-Private for example, could mean a chest high\n   separator, a booth or an entire sliding wall\n * Greater prominence for the restaurant’s brand within the booking flow itself.\n   (In other words, more white labeling).\n\nPlease open in Figma\n[https://www.figma.com/file/x9kHK7MXSyAwmuIStn9XRE/1015-Standard-form-Journey-Lehel?node-id=0%3A1] \nto view in more detailOutcomes\nWhile there was more we could do, this was polished and well defined enough for\nus to get signoff on a v1 of this release. At this stage, my involvement with\nthe project was at an end, since I was leaving TableCheck. The engineering team\nhad begun to do the backend work to deliver what we had designed, and have begun\non some frontend prototyping as well.\n\nThough there were still things we wanted to test, some of the early outcomes of\nsharing these prototypes with clients and some limited diners have been:\n\n * 2 contracts saved and 2 new ones booked. (The new ones being large\n   enterprise)\n * The successful completion of a form that had a notoriously high abandonment\n   rate","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2021-05-09 15:16:33","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2021-05-10 15:15:25","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2021-05-09 15:16:41","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"A case study looking at our process for the design and delivery of the new TableCheck reservation experience.
