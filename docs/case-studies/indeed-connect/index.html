						<p>Indeed Connect came about as a way to fundamentally rethink how Indeed worked, tailoring an
							experience that focused more on conversations, connecting the right people, and less on
							formal applications. </p>
						<p>To help put all this into better perspective, let's start with looking at how Indeed
							functions today.<br></p>
						<h2 id="about-indeed">About Indeed</h2>
						<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img
								src="../content/images/2022/08/ID-Header.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"
								width="2000" height="434"

								sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure>
						<p>Indeed today is an open platform. Jobs can be posted directly to the site, with additional
							jobs also getting aggregated from different sources for a "one stop job hunting shop". As a
							jobseeker, you can go and search for any job, in any location and depending on the job,
							apply even without having created an Indeed account. </p>
						<p>For employers, the bar isn't much higher. The basic employer journey over a job's lifecycle
							looks something like this.</p>
						<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img
								src="../content/images/2022/09/job-lifecycle-1.svg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"
								width="2048" height="176"></figure>
						<p>The only real requirements for a job post are a title, location and a description longer than
							a few words. We prompt you for additional information such as required licenses etc... where
							applicable, and try to upsell you for paid services along the way, but these pieces of
							information are optional and posting a job will always be free. </p>
						<p>For both employers and candidates, the main way to connect is through submitting a (sometimes
							lengthy) formal application, at which point, employers have the opportunity to reach out.
						</p>
						<p></p>
						<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card" ><img style="margin-left: 0;" src="../content/images/2022/09/Logomark-Header.svg"
								class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="740" height="32"></figure>
						<p>Indeed Connect flips all this on it's head by doing the following:</p>
						<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img

								I will be including examples of some job seeker facing UIs to help paint a more cohesive

						</figure>
						<p>Both employers and job seekers need to have a dedicated Indeed account with a verified
							identity to participate. </p>

						<p>For employers, in addition to account verification, we also collect structured data about the

							better matching between both parties. </p>

						<p>This is where a lot of the magic happens. For jobseekers, after opting in to the program they
							are automatically (and only) shown jobs that are a good potential fit. And in place of  a
							formal, lengthy application process, jobseekers can indicate interest in a job with a single
							tap, or message an employer directly.</p>

						<p>Though having candidates message you directly can sound intimidating to employers, our

							match for the job.</p>

								class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="873" height="860"></figure>
						<p>Employers however, have to respond to all interested candidates in a timely manner. If the
							employer's response time goes past 3 days, we put their job on hold until they get caught
							up.</p>
						<p>So what's the benefit? Why would employers want to jump through these hoops and be
							accountable for taking action on every candidate that they see?</p>

							<figcaption>The bones of what would later become our research wiki</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>We started things off with a pretty lean team of just a product manager, an engineer and
							myself. As resourcing and logistics were worked out, my goal was to use this time to dig
							into the wealth of existing research we had at Indeed around our personas, the problems they
							face and prior explorations on any similar ideas in the past. Building research summaries
							about these learnings into more easily consumable highlights for my counterparts helped
							focus some of our early planning.</p>

							<figcaption>Team growth over 6 months</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>It also  became even more useful as our team grew, since it gave new joiners a single,
							consolidated resource to review during their onboarding, helping them get up to speed.</p>
						<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
						<p>As we moved from initial market research and evaluation to building, my goal was to try and
							help make sure we had a shared understanding of who are target users were, and the core
							problems we were trying to solve.</p>
						<p>We had a wealth of persona research to draw on and quickly aligned on Hiring Managers as our
							best option.</p>
						<p>The main challenge was to nail down the various user problems we've discussed amongst the
							leads, but haven't yet consolidated into anything more tangible.</p>

							<figcaption>If you ran a design thinking workshop and don't have any photos of sticky notes

						<p>In this case I decided to do this by riffing on the classic <a
								href="https://www.digitalnatives.hu/blog/value-proposition-canvas/">value proposition
								canvas</a>. Listing out the different Tasks, Gains and Pains our target persona faces
							while hiring on Indeed; followed by a second exercise focusing on coming up with solutions
							to these problems.</p>
						<p>These clusters then lead into a list of needs statements, coupled with high level solutions.

						<p>This helped PM start to better articulate the core value propositions of our product, and
							drive some discussions on prioritization. In addition, breaking the high level solutions
							down to a more specific set of features and existing implementations had two benefits.</p>
						<p>• It helped engineering start some of their investigations and call out potential risks to
							our timeline early on.<br>• It helped highlight potential dependencies we had on other
							teams.</p>
						<p>These solutions would later be turned into epics in JIRA, with the needs statements being
							part of the UX requirements, as we continued to break the work down into further chunks over
							time. </p>
						<h3 id="iterating">Iterating</h3>
						<p>There were two high level approaches we were evaluating early on.</p>
						<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
						<h3>Job centric approach</h3>
						<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="1000" height="500"
							src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FRLJW33ZZzh4FfFeXpMCEIq%2FUntitled%3Fnode-id%3D2%253A26139"
							allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<!--kg-card-end: html-->
						<p>This first approach focused more on surfacing job level entry points and putting job
							management and communication at the core of the experience.</p>
						<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
						<h3>User account centric approach</h3>
						<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450"
							src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FRLJW33ZZzh4FfFeXpMCEIq%2FUntitled%3Fnode-id%3D11%253A26501"
							allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<!--kg-card-end: html-->
						<p>The second approach focused more on building a "Responsiveness Dashboard", emphasizing things
							like reputation scores, response times and gamification. </p>
						<p>After reviewing amongst ourselves and with the executive team, we decided to focus on the
							first approach. A focus on jobs made more sense as a starting point for a few reasons.</p>
						<p>1) While we wanted to incentivize responsiveness and good behaviour, this should be a
							<strong>result</strong> of effective job management and staying on top of your messages -
							not the main focus itself. </p>
						<p>2) This approach allowed us to integrate and anchor our entrypoints in the UI off the
							existing jobs management page, while the dashboard would have been a whole new product space
							we'd have to build.</p>
						<!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800"
							height="450"
							src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FRLJW33ZZzh4FfFeXpMCEIq%2FUntitled%3Fnode-id%3D196%253A46231"
							allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<!--kg-card-end: html-->
						<p>As we started converging on a solution, our iterations became more focused, exploring
							different variations on our core concepts. The shortlisted ones, we decided to put in front
							of users for some early testing and validation.</p>
						<h3 id="test">Test</h3>
						<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FRLJW33ZZzh4FfFeXpMCEIq%2FIndeed-Connect-CS-Demo%3Fnode-id%3D36%253A27014" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p>The things we wanted to evaluate at this stage were the following:<br><strong>Messaging and
								Value Props</strong>: Were employers fully understanding the features and benefits of
							the program? Were they understanding the 3 day responsiveness requirement?<br><strong>Task
								completion</strong>: Were they able to actually complete the job setup, and then respond
							to new messages and applicants?</p>
						<p>We learned the following:</p>

						<h3 id="adjust">Adjust</h3>
						<p>To address the above feedback, we adjusted the designs the following ways:</p>

							allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<!--kg-card-end: html-->
						<p>Added additional "free" badging to different entrypoints. </p>
						<!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800"

						<!--kg-card-end: html-->
						<p>Broke each category of questions out into distinct steps, and added additional helper text to
							provide more transparency on how information from each question will be used.</p>
						<h3 id="build">Build</h3>
						<p>To get our MVP out the door on time meant that engineering had to start as soon as possible,
							and would happen in parallel tracks with design. </p>
						<p>As shown above, a lot of our early explorations focused on nailing down things like
							information architecture, general layout structure and task flows in order to allow the dev
							team to begin building out the necessary backend systems and APIs first, giving design
							additional time to test, iterate, converge and dial in specs.</p>
						<p>During this process our engineers would often have new feedback, which would be incorporated
							into the designs, alongside additional stakeholder and user testing feedback. </p>
						<p>The challenge with this approach was that design lead time often tended to be relatively
							short (2~ sprints generally). The upside was that it meant there was relatively little time
							wasted on building high fidelity mockups and detailed specs for things that would end up
							being de-scoped. </p>
						<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
						<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FRLJW33ZZzh4FfFeXpMCEIq%2FIndeed-Connect-CS-Demo%3Fnode-id%3D321%253A63845" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<!--kg-card-end: html-->
						<p>And since engineers were involved with a design from the beginning, there was a greater sense
							of ownership, and a better understanding of the designs, requiring less reviews from UX
							during implementation and QA. </p>
							<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FRLJW33ZZzh4FfFeXpMCEIq%2FIndeed-Connect-CS-Demo%3Fnode-id%3D772%253A72105" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p>The other challenge was co-ordinating with outside teams who owned systems and product areas
							we relied on, or in some cases would be contributing to. As in any major company, these
							teams would often have their own OKRs, contribution processes, design feedback or ongoing
							code migrations that we had to work with. So getting buyin, building these relationships and
							getting their teams involved early was crucial to our own success as well.</p>

						<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
						<p>As with any new experiment, we took our time ramping up traffic, progressively increasing the
							percentage of users we exposed the service to over time. Below are a few of our outcomes,
							lessons and next steps as of the writing of this case study.</p>

						<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
						<p>There's been a lot of lessons but some of the high level ones are:</p>
						<p><strong>Highlight dependencies and begin collaborations early </strong><br>I touched on this
							above. We did a good job with some teams, but could have done better with others. A lack of
							control amplifies risk exponentially. While we were able to adjust designs and roadmaps
							accordingly, managing dependencies and delivering work that overlapped with so many
							different areas was one of the bigger challenges of this project.</p>
						<p><strong>Give people a voice. Help them help you.</strong><br>That being said -  we're all on
							the same team. When reaching out to other teams for collaboration, making sure that they
							feel heard, and figuring out a way our work can benefit both sides often went a long way in
							getting early buy in. </p>
						<p>Design by its nature is also a collaborative process, and as designers, we're often more used
							to giving and receiving feedback than folks in other disciplines. Taking the lead in driving
							these discussions can help teams align and move forward more quickly. </p>
						<p><strong>Cross timezone collaboration can be hard </strong><br>We had team members spread
							across APAC, Europe and US timezones. This caused some growing pains at the beginning, but
							here are some things we did that helped streamline the process:</p>
						<p>• Consolidate sources of truth, documenting everything from discussions to decisions. </p>
						<p>• Build in time for async feedback. Make it a habit to follow up on any loose threads. If a
							question doesn't get resolved in 3~ days online, team calls and syncs should be regular
							enough to help address it there.</p>
						<p><strong>Don't let perfect be the enemy of good – but don't ship something you're not prepared
								to live with</strong><br>Bit cliche, but it's always easier to iterate on an existing
							solution. Better to get something out there and then build and refine over time, than to
							have half a year pass you by and ship nothing. </p>
						<p>That being said, try to make sure you're not painting yourself into a corner down the line.
							Temporary solutions have a way of sticking around, and can come bite you later. I've been
							down this road before so I was mindful of it when making decisions for our team, but was
							still reminded along the way - one of the teams we worked with ran into significant delays
							with a refactor that also blocked us. We were able to help them along, but it added about 3
							weeks of development time on our end we didn't initially plan for.</p>
						<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
						<p>Now that our MVP is out in the wild our main focus is on:</p>
						<p><strong>Measure and expand</strong><br>We piloted our MVP with a few specific jobs such as
							Nurses, Line Cooks and about 10 other job categories in the US. Our goal is to continue
							ramping up our program, measuring and improving our matching algorithms and the quality of
							the data we capture, eventually expanding to most if not all jobs internationally.</p>
						<p><strong>Improve employer response times and messaging</strong><br>We started with a blanket
							"respond in 3 days" but we have more recent research and data to indicate employers would be
							comfortable with much tighter requirements under the right conditions. Our ultimate goal is
							to help get all employers on Indeed Connect to respond within one business day, and getting
							there will be a major initiative for 2023.</p>
						<p><strong>Building the mobile app</strong><br>This will help decouple us from some of the
							legacy issues we had to navigate with the web based experience, and help build a better
							messaging experience for employers (which should also tie in with the response time
							improvements above).</p>
